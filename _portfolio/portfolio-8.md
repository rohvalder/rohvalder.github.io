As in Netflix, we receive recommendations of movies to be watched based on the list of movies watched in the past; I plan to analyze the reviews and recommend movies for future watch. The movies are ranked considering the average of all the reviews for a movie, and the top 10 of them, are suggested to be watched. Recommend ten movies to the user based on the reviews received.
