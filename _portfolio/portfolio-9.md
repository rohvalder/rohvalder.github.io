If you have read the book by Malcolm Gladwell, then you will be familiar with Dr.John Gottman, who is renowned in the field of psychology and predicts with accuracy the couple who would divorce. By meeting the couple, Dr.Gottman can understand the negative communication and the criticism and defensiveness. So is there a way through data science we can identify who will divorce with accuracy better than Dr.John Gottman? Dr.Gottman boasts an accuracy rate of 94%. The goal of my case study is if machine learning can predict divorce with higher accuracy than a human expert.
